        Node are called Vertex in graph

       Graph can be directed or undirected
       Undirected : No direction assigned to edges
       Directed :  direction assigned to edges

       **Terminology in graph**

       1.Path : Set of edges that connect a set of nodes.
         path can be two types:
         a. closed path(starting node is same as ending node)
         b. simple path(Nodes are not repeated in a path)

       2.Loop : An edges that connects a vertex to itself

       3.Degree of nodes : Number of edges connecting a node to graph

        In case of undirected graph
        loop is considered as 2degree

        In case of directed graph
        Two types of degree of node in directed graph
        a. In Degree : # of edges coming in
        b. Out Degree: # of edges going out
            in the case of loop : In Degree is 1 and out Degree is 1

       4.Cycle Graph : Graph with # of nodes equal to # of edges

       5.Connected Graph : We can visit any node from any other node.

       6.Complete Graph : Each node is connected to every other node with exactly one edge.

       8.Weighted Graph : Each edge has value(weight) assigned to it.

       9.Simple Graph : Graph having no loops or parallel edges.



       Representation of Graphs
       1.Adjacency Matrix : Use 2d array or a hash map ot represent the graph
       2.Adjacency List : Use an array of linked lists to represent the graph
