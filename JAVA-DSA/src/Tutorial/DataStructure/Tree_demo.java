//        Terminology in Tree

//        Nodes: The element of the tree is called Nodes
//        Edges: The path the connecting two different nodes
//        Leaf Nodes : The end Nodes that do not have any children nodes
//        Root Node : The first Nodes of the tree
//        Parent Node: The node above any nodes
//        Height of the tree : The maximum distance from the root node to leaf node
//        Node Height : The maximum distance from the children nodes to parent nodes


//        Types of Trees

//        Binary Tree: Maximum number of children a node can have is 2
/*        Binary Search Tree: Binary tree with the nodes that are sorted

           **Types of Binary Tree**
           1.Full Binary Tree :  All nodes of the binary tree have 0 children or 2 children
           2.Complete Binary Tree : All levels of the tree are filled except last level which may be filled from the left

        **properties of binary search tree**
       left node < parent node
       right node > parent node

       all left nodes < parent node
       all right nodes > parent node

       **Types of Binary Search Tree**
       1.Unbalanced trees
       2.Balanced trees

       **Tree traversing(visiting each node of the tree)**
       There are 3 different ways to traverse a tree
       Inorder : left+root+right
       Preorder : root+left+right
       Postorder : Left+Right+Root
